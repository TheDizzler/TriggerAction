An Action RPG prototype. Using Assets from ChronoTrigger...because reasons.
My first attempt at a real-time fighting game and creating pseudo 3D effect with 2D sprites.

##The List
>- make jump attack change jump distance to closest target
>- diagonal attacks
>- level start and exits
>- odd draw crash after player death (psshader??)
>- in-game player drop-in/drop-out
>- player-controlled (and auto-scroll?) level
>- HUD updates on enemy appear/die


##Other notes
>- Push to DXTKGui project: made changes to Texturizable to allow passing of ID3D11Device for more batch drawing control
